## Rusty Snake ##

A translation of my [other Snake program](https://github.com/PtravisCS/snake) originally programmed in C.
The goal of this project was to simply try and recreate the program using Rust so as to gain more experience with the language.

This branch is an attempt to refactor the program to use the Termion TUI library instead of NCurses.
It is currently incomplete and non-functional.
